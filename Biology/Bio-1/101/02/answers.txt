1. F. All listed senses are present in a human body. Sight or vision is the capability of the eye(s) to focus and detect images of visible light on photoreceptors in the retina of each eye that generates electrical nerve impulses for varying colors, hues, and brightness. Taste is one of the traditional five senses. It refers to the capability to detect the taste of substances such as food, certain minerals, and poisons, etc. Proprioception, the kinesthetic sense, provides the parietal cortex of the brain with information on the relative positions of the parts of the body. Nociception (physiological pain) signals nerve-damage or damage to tissue. Chronoception refers to how the passage of time is perceived and experienced. Although the sense of time is not associated with a specific sensory system the work of psychologists and neuroscientists indicates that human brains do have a system governing the perception of time.
2. C. In common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) magnetite has been found but its biological use is still not proven. The vibrissal crypts of the Guiana dolphin (Sotalia guianensis) were shown to be capable of electroreception sufficient to detect small fish, as low as 4.8 Î¼V/cm. The dolphin's head contains the melon, a round organ used for echolocation. Dolphin teeth are believed to function as antennae to receive incoming sound and to pinpoint the exact location of an object. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood.
